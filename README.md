# TypeScript Discord Bot Basic Starter

## Introduction

This project was created based on the [DiscordJS documentation guide](https://discordjs.guide/creating-your-bot/) and adapted to TypeScript, which the documentation does not offer. It provides a very simple basis to start developing a discord bot with TypeScript.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run start`

Runs the build.

### `npm run dev`

Runs the bot in the development mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the bot for production to the `build` folder. The build is minified, your bot is ready to be deployed!
